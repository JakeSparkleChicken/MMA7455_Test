# MMA7455_Test

I just picked up a NUCLEO board to learn about the STM32 platform.  The only I2C sensor that I had kicking around was an old Parallax MMA7445 3-axis accelerometer, so I figured that I'd start with that.  I've got a SPI SD card reader and a GPS that communicates over UART so I can hit all three of the major busses.

The bulk of the code was generated with STI's STMCubeMX.
